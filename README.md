This portfolio was made to show off my skills in Web Development. The site has links to multiple projects, and is managed using Contentful. Contentful is a headless CMS(content management system), and is being used to manage the portolio projects media. This is a React app using NextJs as the production framework. The portfolio is styled with Tailwind-CSS.
